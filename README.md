This project is about the touristic development in the region of Schladming-Dachstein and Saalbach-Hinterglemm. We wanted to find out wether the Schi-WM in 2013 had any impact on the overnight stays. The projekt was realized during the course "Scripting & Coding" which is part of the programm "Journalism & PR" at the FH Joanneum in Graz.

Project members: Pirmin Steiner, Michael Sommer, Julia Putzger, Markus RÃ¶ck and Laura Reibenschuh
